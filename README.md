The "data_science_machine_learning" GitHub repository contains projects from a data science and machine learning bootcamp, as well as projects completed on the DataCamp platform. These projects cover Python programming, data manipulation, data visualization, importing and cleaning data, and basic machine learning algorithms like regression, classification, clustering, and decision trees. Additionally, the repository includes a project on CNN and utilizes libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, plotly, seaborn, and basic TensorFlow. It also features a winning solution for a Kaggle competition on house price prediction in Azerbaijan, where it secured first place among 40 participants from the bootcamp.
